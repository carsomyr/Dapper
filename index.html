<h2 class="section_heading">Why Dapper?</h2>
<div class="section_body">
<p>
We live in interesting times, where breakthroughs in the sciences increasingly depend on the growing availability and abundance of commoditized, networked computational resources.
With the help of the cloud or grid, computations that would otherwise run for days on a single desktop machine now have distributed and/or parallel formulations that can churn through, in a matter of hours, input sets ten times as large on a hundred machines.
As alluring as the idea of strength in numbers may be, having just physical hardware is not enough -- a programmer has to craft the actual computation that will run on it.
Consequently, the high value placed on human effort and creativity necessitates a programming environment that enables, and even encourages, succinct expression of distributed computations, and yet at the same time does not sacrifice generality.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dapper</b>, standing for <b>D</b>istributed <b>a</b>nd <b>P</b>arallel <b>P</b>rogram <b>E</b>xecution <b>R</b>untime, is one such tool for bridging the scientist/programmer's high level specifications that capture the essence of a program, with the low level mechanisms that reflect the unsavory realities of distributed and parallel computing.
Under its dataflow-oriented approach, Dapper enables users to code locally in Java and execute globally on the cloud or grid.
The user first writes codelets, or small snippets of code that perform simple tasks and do not, in themselves, constitute a complete program.
Afterwards, he or she specifies how those codelets, seen as vertices in the dataflow, transmit data to each other via edge relations.
The resulting directed acyclic dataflow graph is a complete program interpretable by the Dapper server, which, upon being contacted by long-lived worker clients, can coordinate a distributed execution.
</p>
<p>
Under the Dapper model, the user no longer needs to worry about traditionally ad-hoc aspects of managing the cloud or grid, which include handling data interconnects and dependencies, recovering from errors, distributing code, and starting jobs.
Perhaps more importantly, it provides an entire Java-based toolchain and runtime for framing nearly all coarse-grained distributed computations in a consistent format that allows for rapid deployment and easy conveyance to other researchers.

<h2 class="section_heading">Features</h2>
<div class="section_body">
<p>
To offer prospective users a glimpse of the system's capabilities, we quickly summarize many of Dapper's features that improve upon existing systems, or are new altogether:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A code distribution system that allows the Dapper server to transmit requisite program code over the network and have clients dynamically load it.
A consequence of this is that, barring external executables, updates to Dapper programs need only happen on the server-side.</li>
<li>A powerful subflow embedding method for dynamically modifying the dataflow graph at runtime.</li>
<li>A runtime in vanilla Java, a language that many are no doubt familiar with.
Aside from the requirement of a recent JVM and optionally Graphviz <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Dot</a>, Dapper is self-contained.</li>
<li>A robust control protocol.
The Dapper server expects any number of clients to fail, at any time, and has customizable re-execution and timeout policies to cope.
Consequently, one can start and stop (long-lived) clients without fear of putting the entire system into an inconsistent state.</li>
<li>Flexible semantics that allow data transfers via files or TCP streams.</li>
<li>Interoperability with firewalls.
Since your local cloud or grid probably sits behind a firewall, we have devised special semantics for streaming data transfers.</li>
<li>Liberal licensing terms.
Dapper is released under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">New BSD License</a> to prevent contamination of your codebase.</li>
<li>Operation as an embedded application.
A <a href="manual.pdf">user manual</a> describes the programming API that users can follow to run the Dapper server inside an application like <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>.</li>
<li>Operation as a standalone user interface.
With it, one can run off-the-shelf demos and learn core concepts from visual examples.
By following a minimal set of conventions, one can then bundle one's own Dapper programs as execution archives, and then get realtime dataflow status and debugging feedback.</li>
</ul>

Here's how to obtain Dapper and/or learn more about it:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/dapper/downloads/list">Downloads</a> of source and Jar distributions.</li>
<li><a href="manual.pdf">A user manual</a> detailing the rationale behind Dapper, ready-to-use demos, and the programming API.</li>
<li><a href="javadoc/">Javadocs</a> of member classes, or, for the eternally curious, <a href="doxydoc/">Doxygen</a> of the native components.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/carsomyr/dapper">A Git repository</a> of browseable code.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To get up and running quickly, download the two Jars <code>dapper.jar</code> and <code>dapper-ex.jar</code> (modulo some version number <code>x.xx</code>).
You will need to have Graphviz <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Dot</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java</a> 1.6.*+ handy.
Start the user interface with the command
</p>
<blockquote>
<code>java -jar dapper.jar</code>,
</blockquote>
<p>
or, if your operating system associates the <code>.jar</code> extension with a JRE, by clicking on the icon.
Drag and drop the Jar of examples, <code>dapper-ex.jar</code>, into the box containing the "Archives" tree.
You will see a few selections; select the one that says "ex.SimpleTest", and then press the "run" button.
Now start at least four worker clients by repeatedly issuing the command
</p>
<blockquote>
<code>java -cp dapper.jar org.dapper.client.ClientDriver</code>.
</blockquote>
<p>
By now, you should see the user interface begin to step through the "Simple Test" computation.
Although everything is happening on the local machine, the Dapper server embedded in the user interface is completely agnostic to the actual disposition of clients.
Thus, fully distributed operation is intrinsically no harder than the steps laid out above.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, all of the above can be accomplished by downloading the <code>dapper-src.tgz</code> distribution and running the <code>test.py</code> script (Unix-based) or <code>buildandtest.exe</code> executable (Windows) from the Dapper base directory.
</p>
<p>
Finally, <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> users can import the source distribution or version control working image, which contain <code>.project</code> and <code>.classpath</code> files, directly.
Note that the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/">IvyDE</a> plugin is required to properly set up the class path.
</p>
<p>
If you think Dapper is a promising solution to your distributed computing needs, have a look at the user manual for a much more in-depth tour.
Also, consider downloading the full, Tar'd distribution and building the Java sources.
